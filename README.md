## Success Metrics

You are requested to fulfill the following user stories: </br>
**User Story #1**: I can see a 100x100px element with a corresponding `id="picker"​`.
The element will show a gradient going from black to the color of your choice. </br>
**User Story #2**: I can see a 50x100px element with a corresponding `id="swatch"​`. </br>
**User Story #3**: I can see an input with a corresponding **id="hslString"​**. </br>
**User Story #4**: When I click anywhere inside the `#picker​` element, the `#swatch​` element background is updated and shows the clicked color. </br>
**User Story #5**: When I click anywhere inside the `#picker​` element, the `#hslString​` input is updated and show the HSL string of the clicked color. </br>
**Optional Bonus** (_you do not need to make this test pass_): When I hover over the color picker a zoomed version of the current hover spot is following the cursor . </br>
**Optional Bonus** (_you do not need to make this test pass_): clicking the `#hslString​` the value of the input circles between different color strings (i.e RGB -> HSL -> HEX) </br>
